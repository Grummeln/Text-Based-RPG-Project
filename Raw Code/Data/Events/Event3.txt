A man is sitting on the side of the road, eating a very strange looking fruit. He sees you and laughs, asking if you would like to try his fruit. After you ask about the fruit, the man says it is known in his land as the "fruit of the gods", and that he is willing to share a bite with you, as long as you do not tell anyone what it tastes like.

Will you take up his offer? ( yes/no )
