A small camp has been set up on the side of the road. There is a fire, with a pot hanging over it. There are no people there, but there is a piece of paper held down by a rock. Approaching, you find it is a note that says "Hello travellers, come sit by our fire and share a meal." There are cups, bowls and spoons on the ground, complimented by a large pot of seemingly freshly made soup.

Will you eat the soup? ( yes/no )
