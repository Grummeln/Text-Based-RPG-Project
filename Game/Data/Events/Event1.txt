A large tree stands in the middle of the road and massive spider's webs are strung between the branches of the tree. A large spider is in the centre of the web, cocooned inside it. When you approach you notice that the spider is not moving at all. After further investigation, you see that the spider has been dead for some time, but also that there is an egg sac attached to the spider's body. The egg sac is about the size of a human head and very light, almost hollow.

Will you crush it? ( yes/no )
