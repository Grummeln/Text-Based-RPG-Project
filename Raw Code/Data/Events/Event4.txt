A clearing contains a massive deer, its tanned flesh hung from a structure made from saplings and vines. It looks like some sort of ceremonial space for hunters. At the entrance, you find pieces of paper and animal bones laid out on a little stone pergola near the hanging carcass. These seem to be prayers to some kind of nature god.

Will you eat the dubious flesh? ( yes/no )
