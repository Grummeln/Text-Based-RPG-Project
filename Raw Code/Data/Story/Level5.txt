After a fight that felt hopeless, regardless of results and difficulty, you felt as if you've vanquished the Uneasing Presence in the throne room. Relief washes over you, you close your eyes, take a deep breath... Then your heart sinks. You cannot open your eyes. You're lost within yourself-- what was the point of your journey? Suddenly sunken in thought, you open your eyes again, only to find yourself in a dark, empty void. Whatever the enemy is, it led you right where it wanted. You do not know how, or why, but whatever it made you do inside of the palace's throne room, it caused reality to crumble.
