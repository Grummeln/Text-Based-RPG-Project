Suddenly a large group of palace servants appear from behind some pillars. They have surrounded you and started to pound on pots and pans furiously. Two of them walk out with beautifully decorated torches, frightening you and forcing you to sprint away from their hall, deeper into the castle. The servants will keep roaming the halls, looking for other clueless adventurers to harass, before melting back into shadows as if they were never there at all. Yet you leave with a sense of confusion. It was an experience, you think you've learned something from it, but you are unsure.
